class Singleton(object):
    '''
    Modeled after
    http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.2.3/descrintro/*__new__

    A thread-safe (mostly -- see NOTE) Singleton class pattern.

    NOTE: deleting a singleton instance (i.e. Singleton::delInstance) does not
    guarantee that nothing else is currently using it. To reduce this risk, a
    program should not hold a reference to the instance.  Rather, use the
    create/construct syntax (see example below) to access the instance.  Yet,
    this still does not guarantee that this type of usage will result in a
    desired effect in a multithreaded program.
    You've been warned so use the singleton pattern wisely!

    Example:

    class MySingletonClass(Singleton):
            def init(self):
                    print "in MySingletonClass::init()", self

            def foo(self):
                    print "in MySingletonClass::foo()", self

    MySingletonClass().foo()
    MySingletonClass().foo()
    MySingletonClass().foo()

    ---> output will look something like this:
    in MySingletonClass::init() <__main__.MySingletonClass object at 0x7ff5b322f3d0>
    in MySingletonClass::foo() <__main__.MySingletonClass object at 0x7ff5b322f3d0>
    in MySingletonClass::foo() <__main__.MySingletonClass object at 0x7ff5b322f3d0>
    in MySingletonClass::foo() <__main__.MySingletonClass object at 0x7ff5b322f3d0>
    '''

    lock = threading.RLock()

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        try:
            cls.lock.acquire()
            it = cls.__dict__.get('__it__')
            if it is not None:
                return it
            cls.__it__ = it = object.__new__(cls)
            it.init(*args, **kwargs)
            return it
        finally:
            cls.lock.release()

    def init(self, *args, **kwargs):
        '''
        Derived classes should override this method to do its initializations
        The derived class should not implement a '__init__' method.
        '''
        pass

    @classmethod
    def delInstance(cls):
        cls.lock.acquire()
        try:
            if cls.__dict__.get('__it__') is not None:
